# Streamlit vs FastAPI: Questions & Answers

---

### Q1: What is Streamlit?

**A:**  
Streamlit is a Python framework designed to build **interactive data apps** and dashboards quickly. It allows data scientists and developers to create web apps with minimal coding, focusing on visualizations and interactivity without needing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

### Q3: What are the main differences between Streamlit and FastAPI?

| Feature        | Streamlit                                  | FastAPI                                        |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose        | Build interactive data apps and dashboards | Build web APIs (backend services)              |
| UI             | Has built-in UI components                   | No built-in UI; API only                        |
| Performance    | Good for prototyping; not for high-load apps | Very fast and scalable for production          |
| Ease of Use    | Very easy for Python users                   | Moderate; requires understanding of APIs       |
| Use Cases     | ML demos, dashboards, data visualization     | Production APIs, model serving, backend logic   |

### Q4: When should I use Streamlit?

**A:**  
Use Streamlit if you want to:
- Quickly turn a Python script or notebook into an interactive web app.
- Create dashboards or visual tools for data analysis or ML models.
- Avoid frontend coding (HTML/JS/CSS).

---

### Q5: When should I use FastAPI?

**A:**  
Use FastAPI if you want to:
- Build a robust, scalable backend API.
- Serve ML models or data via REST endpoints.
- Handle authentication, async requests, or complex API logic.

---

### Q6: Can I use Streamlit and FastAPI together?

**A:**  
Yes! A common pattern is:
- Use FastAPI for your backend API logic and model serving.
- Use Streamlit to create a user-friendly frontend that interacts with your API.
